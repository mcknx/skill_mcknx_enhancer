# Skill Mcknx Enhancer

## Mission
This repository is an **AI-era learning system** to help me grow from beginner to **senior/architect level** while still understanding real code deeply.

The goal is not just to finish tutorials.
The goal is to **build real apps from scratch**, then revisit and dissect them later at architecture/orchestration level.

---

## What this repo is about
I want this project to become a long-term training platform for mastering:

- Next.js
- React Native
- n8n
- Node.js

I learn each technology **from easy to advanced (zero to hero)** by building many practical apps and then reviewing:

- Why the architecture was chosen
- Trade-offs and alternatives
- Scalability and reliability decisions
- Security and observability decisions
- How each part is orchestrated end-to-end

## Core Learning Philosophy

1. **Hands-on first**: every concept is tied to building something real.
2. **Architect mindset**: every app must be explainable at system level, not only code level.
3. **Revisitable design**: projects are structured so they can be reviewed months/years later.
4. **Progressive complexity**: start simple, then layer production concerns.
5. **AI-assisted, human-understood**: use AI to move faster, but keep understanding of internals.

## Product Direction
This repo powers a website where I can:

- Practice scenario-based learning
- Track progress by technology
- Review app case studies from beginner to advanced
- Inspect architecture notes for each app
- Compare implementation patterns across projects

---

## Build Plan (Long-Term)
I may build **dozens to 100+ apps** across the 4 technologies, as long as each app is meaningful and teaches a real architectural lesson.

Each app path should include:

- **Level** (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced)
- **Problem statement**
- **Implementation**
- **Architecture breakdown**
- **Review checklist**
- **Refactor/evolution notes**

---

## Definition of Success
This repo succeeds if I can:

- Build confidently in all 4 technologies
- Explain design decisions at senior/architect level
- Revisit old projects and quickly understand system structure
- Move from coding features to designing systems

---

## Status
Current platform supports interactive scenarios and is being expanded to fully support:

- Next.js track
- React Native track
- n8n track
- Node.js track

with progressive, architecture-focused learning content.
